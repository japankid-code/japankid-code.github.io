			<p class="details">According to mythology, Issie was a white mare turned into a lake monster
				due to the despair of losing her child to a samurai. Since then she frequently
				surfaces on the shore of Lake Ikeda, trying to find her lost child. Although,
				Issie may not be as alone as she thinks since it seems she has a cousin
				called Kusshi in Hokkaido, northern Japan.</p>
